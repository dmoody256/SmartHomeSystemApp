Propeller Code Readme

This folder contains all the spin code used in this project. Spin code is a high level language specifically 
designed for use in the propeller micro controller chips. You can download a propeller IDE from Paralax if
you would like to compile the code to a chip.

This code here was written for use on the Paralax Spinneret Web Server Board connected with an XBee wireless module.
The HTTPserver is the code I modified for this project. It is used to connect to the Smartphone App and 
communicate to the Xbee devices. The rest of the code are packages that are called by the HTTP server code.
